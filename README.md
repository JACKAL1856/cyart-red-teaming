Project Title  
Red Team Fundamentals and Attack Simulation Labs

Project Overview  
This repository documents foundational Red Team concepts and controlled attack simulations performed in authorized lab environments. The objective of this project is to understand attacker methodologies, identify common security weaknesses, and analyze how such activities are detected and mitigated within enterprise environments.

The focus is on methodology, ethical execution, and documentation rather than aggressive exploitation.

Scope of Activities  
- Basic attack surface identification  
- Web application vulnerability discovery  
- Credential-based attack simulations in lab environments  
- Understanding detection and response perspectives  

Methodology  
Activities documented in this repository follow a structured approach:
- Reconnaissance and environment understanding  
- Identification of potential attack vectors  
- Controlled execution of test cases  
- Observation of security control behavior  
- Documentation of findings and defensive considerations  

Tools and Technologies  
- Nmap for reconnaissance and enumeration  
- Burp Suite for web request analysis  
- Linux-based testing environments  
- Open-source security testing utilities  

Key Learnings  
- Improved understanding of attacker workflows  
- Appreciation of defensive controls and detection mechanisms  
- Importance of ethical boundaries and authorization  
- Value of clear documentation in security assessments  

Ethical Disclaimer  
All activities documented in this repository were conducted in authorized, isolated lab environments strictly for educational purposes. No testing was performed against live or production systems.

Next Enhancements  
- Deeper mapping of activities to the MITRE ATT&CK framework  
- Inclusion of detection and response perspectives  
- Expansion into blue team impact analysis
