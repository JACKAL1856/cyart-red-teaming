  Project Title  
Threat Detection and SOC Engineering Labs

Project Overview  
This repository documents hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) engineering and threat detection exercises performed in controlled lab environments. The objective of this project is to understand how threats are generated, detected, analyzed, and validated using security monitoring tools and structured detection workflows.

The focus is on detection engineering, log analysis, and security visibility rather than offensive exploitation.

Scope of Activities  
- Network intrusion detection using Suricata  
- Threat emulation using MITRE CALDERA  
- Log analysis and event correlation  
- Vulnerability scanning and risk identification  
- Validation of detection and alerting mechanisms  

Key Exercises Performed  
- Configuration and tuning of Suricata rules for network threat detection  
- Execution of adversary emulation scenarios using CALDERA  
- Analysis of logs to identify malicious patterns and anomalies  
- Vulnerability scanning to identify security weaknesses  
- Correlation of alerts with simulated attack activity  

Tools and Technologies  
- Suricata (Network Intrusion Detection System)  
- MITRE CALDERA (Threat Emulation Platform)  
- Log analysis and monitoring concepts  
- Vulnerability scanning tools  
- Linux-based security lab environments  

Detection and Analysis Approach  
Activities were conducted using a structured approach:
- Generate controlled attack activity using emulation tools  
- Monitor network and system logs for indicators of compromise  
- Validate detection accuracy and identify false positives  
- Analyze security events from a SOC perspective  
- Document findings with focus on detection gaps and improvements  

Ethical Disclaimer  
All activities documented in this repository were conducted in isolated, authorized lab environments strictly for educational and skill development purposes. No testing was performed against live, production, or unauthorized systems.

Key Learnings  
- Practical understanding of detection engineering fundamentals  
- Experience correlating attack activity with security alerts  
- Awareness of SOC workflows and analyst responsibilities  
- Importance of visibility, logging, and rule tuning  

Future Enhancements  
- Mapping detections to the MITRE ATT&CK framework  
- Developing custom detection use cases  
- Expanding into incident response and triage workflows
